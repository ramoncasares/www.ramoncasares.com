<h2>Thesis</h2>

<p>
The thesis is that human language is best characterized as a Turing complete language.
A hiearachy of languages is presented where languages are ordered by their expressiveness.
That hierarchy of languages has also some value by itself,
discriminating precisely several kinds of languages,
and giving us a preliminary explanation for the evolution of language.

<p>
This paper was written as a constructive critique to Watumull et al. (2014).
I had already written a first critique in <a href="OR.html">On "On Recursion"</a>,
so this paper is a constructive continuation of that first one.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<h3>Errata</h3>

<p>
The last sentence of §3.9¶4 will be modified
in the next version of the paper, v6, as follows:
the <s>striked text</s> will be deleted and
the <u>underlined text</u> will be added.
</p>

<blockquote><p>
This hierarchy is complete because it spans from the null languages L_0,
where no expression is needed, to the complete languages L_C,
<s>where everything can be expressed</s>
<u>which are the most expressive ones</u>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The reason is that, as proved in
<a href="GT.html">Gödel Incompleteness and Turing Completeness</a>:<br>
<center><i>in every complete language, there is an inexpressible program</i>.</center><br>
So it is not true that everything can be expressed in a complete language.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
A complete hierarchy of languages is introduced
to defend the thesis that
'human language is a Turing complete language'.
This complete hierarchy discriminates languages on
computability, meaning mixability, generativity,
decidability, and expressiveness.
We show that our thesis is true and,
using the complete hierarchy, that our thesis
is more specific and then more significant
than other truths about human language.
The complete hierarchy explains the evolution of language
on the assumption that it was driven by expressiveness,
and consequently it explains that our language is complete
because complete languages are the most expressive languages.

</div>


<h2>Last paragraph</h2>

<p>
Nevertheless, the complete hierarchy can explain
why our language is syntactic, generative, and complete,
since it provides a framework to locate
some phases of the evolution of human language
that the classical hierarchy by Chomsky (1959) does not provide.
Explaining language evolution using the complete hierarchy requires us
to assume that evolutionary fitness has a direct relationship with expressiveness.

<i>
<p>
An initial review of "A Complete Hierarchy of Languages"
has allowed us to conclude that
this submission does not fit within the scope and focus of the journal.
</p>

<p>
Glossa publishes contributions from all areas of linguistics,
provided they contain theoretical implications that shed light
on the nature of language and the language faculty.
</p>

<p>
As far as I can determine,
your article does not seem to contribute new theoretical insights
into the nature of language and the language faculty.
It is also unclear how the hierarchy of languages you propose
relates to actual languages.
This makes your work somewhat disconnected from
actual linguistic practice in theoretical linguistics.

While arXiv serves a variety of scientific communities,
 not all subjects are currently covered.
 Submissions that do not fit well into our current classification scheme

<h3>Journal of Language</h3>
<p>
A version was submitted to Journal of Language in 2019,
 date 2019-04-22.
</p>

<p>
The editor asked an expert, who wrote:
<i>
Consequently, it is difficult for me to argue
either that the “re-discovery” of syntax-semantic self-description
really is either of any novelty
(because has been known for over a half-century)
or of significant interest in furthering our understanding
of the computational character of the human faculty of language.
Better to study Merge directly.
</i>
</p>

<p>
In date 2019-05-07,
and based on the expert report,
the editor rejected the paper:
<i>
In view of its conclusions,
and in particular because the assessment highlights that
your submission is of little interest to theoretical linguists,
I have decided that your paper is not suitable for JL
and therefore will not send it out for review.
</i>
