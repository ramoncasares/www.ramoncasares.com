<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
I wanted to investigate the precise scope of Gödel's incompleteness theorems.
</p>


<h2>Title</h2>

<p>
The first intended title was “Gödel, Post, and Turing”,
abbreviated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT</a>
as the popular IA model.
</p>

<p>
However, in the end, the main result of my investigation was that
<i>every Turing complete language is Gödel incomplete</i>,
so the final title presented itself to me.
</p>


<h2>Technicalities</h2>

<p>
I have adapted the notation of Cantor's (1891) diagonal argument
to conform to Gödel's (1930) notation,
except when I did not follow Gödel, which was only once:
I prefer R<sub>p</sub>(n) to his [R(p);n],
where R<sub>p</sub> is the p-th formalized predicate,
 or class-expresion in Davis' (1965) translation,
and then R<sub>p</sub>(n) denotes the formula
 which arises from R<sub>p</sub> by substitution
 of n for the free variable of the predicate.
</p>



<h2>Two last paragraphs</h2>

<p>
Therefore, the diagonal argument is used to show some limitations of human language,
see §10.2, and of other finitary systems, which derive from it. In these systems, the means
are finite, but we do not limit their use. This is, of course, an idealization, but nevertheless
it would also be wrong to limit, for example, the number of words in a sentence, or the
number of steps in a proof. Summarizing, the incompleteness and unsolvability theorems
by Gödel, Church, and Turing find limitations in our finitary tool, which is our complete
language.
</p>

<p>
And, in any complete language, there are definable concepts that cannot be expressed.
This generalizes Gödel’s incompleteness theorem, see §6¶8, which represents, under the
law of Post, an absolute human limitation, see §7 and §8, which Kant promotes to
transcendental, see §9. So, epistemologically, Gödel’s incompleteness theorem elevates<br>
from Turing’s generalization,<br>
<center><i>every Turing complete language is Gödel incomplete</i>,</center><br>
to its Post-Kantian formulation,<br>
<center><i>knowledge cannot be complete</i>.</center>
</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Following Post program, we will propose a linguistic and empirical
interpretation of Gödel's incompleteness theorem and related ones
on unsolvability by Church and Turing. All these theorems use
the diagonal argument by Cantor in order to find limitations in
finitary systems, as human language, which can make “infinite use of
finite means”. The linguistic version of the incompleteness theorem
says that <i>every Turing complete language is Gödel incomplete</i>. We
conclude that the incompleteness and unsolvability theorems find
limitations in our finitary tool, which is our complete language.
