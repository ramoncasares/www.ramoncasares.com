<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
I wanted to investigate the precise scope of Gödel's incompleteness theorems.
</p>


<h2>Title</h2>

<p>
The first intended title was “Gödel, Post, and Turing”,
abbreviated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT</a>
as the popular IA model.
</p>

<p>
However, in the end, the main result of my investigation was that
<i>every Turing complete language is Gödel incomplete</i>,
so the final title presented itself to me.
</p>


<h2>Two last paragraphs</h2>

<p>
Therefore, the diagonal argument is used to find limitations in human language and
other finitary systems. In these systems, the means are finite, but we do not limit
their use. This is, of course, an idealization, but nevertheless it would also be wrong
to limit, for example, the number of words in a sentence, or the number of steps in a
proof. Summarizing, the incompleteness and unsolvability theorems by Gödel, Church,
and Turing find limitations in our finitary tool, which is our complete language.
</p>

<p>
And, in any complete language, there are definable tasks that cannot be expressed.
This generalizes Gödel’s incompleteness theorem, see §6 ¶8, which represents, under
the law of Post, an absolute human limitation, see §7 and §8, which Kant promotes to
transcendental, see §9. So, epistemologically, Gödel’s incompleteness theorem elevates<br>
from Turing’s generalization,<br>
<center><i>every Turing complete language is Gödel incomplete</i>,</center><br>
to its Post-Kantian formulation,<br>
<center><i>knowledge cannot be complete</i>.</center>
</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Following Post program, we will propose a linguistic and empirical
interpretation of Gödel's incompleteness theorem and related ones
on unsolvability by Church and Turing. All these theorems use
the diagonal argument by Cantor in order to find limitations in
finitary systems, as human language, which can make “infinite use of
finite means”. The linguistic version of the incompleteness theorem
says that <i>every Turing complete language is Gödel incomplete</i>. We
conclude that the incompleteness and unsolvability theorems find
limitations in our finitary tool, which is our complete language.
