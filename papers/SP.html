<h2>Foundations</h2>

<p>
In science, subjectivism has pejorative connotations,
so it is dissmissed so easily
that it has not any chance to present its case.
It is the opposite with physicalism,
which is assumed without doubts.
</p>

<p>
As I am myself a subjectivist,
this paper is written for you physicalists
in the way that I think it will be
easier for you to locate where I am wrong.
Please, tell me.
</p>


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
This paper was born while reading
<i>Philosophy of Mind</i>, Third Edition,
by Jaegwon Kim.
I noticed then that he jumped
from Descartes (17th century) in Chapter 2
to behaviorism (20th century) in Chapter 3
without any mention to Kant (18th century).
With a quick look to the back matter of the book,
I verified that Kant was not indexed.
Anyway, I continued reading it while taking note of any
mention to Kant, but I found none.
</p>

<p>
To me, it was very difficult to believe that Kant was not
dealt with in a book on the <i>Philosophy of Mind</i>,
so I investigated this case further.
In a file containing Kim's textbook,
I searched the string <code>Kant</code>,
resulting a “String ‘Kant’ not found” notification.
Thereafter I repeated the operation, but then in case independent mode,
with the same negative result.
This is really unbelievable, because it means that
the four consecutive letters <b>K</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>N</b>, and <b>T</b>, in that order,
are not found anywhere in the book.
Therefore the string is not in the main text,
 neither as the whole word ‘Kant’ nor in a derivative as ‘Kantian’,
and it is not in the back matter,
 so Kant is neither indexed nor cited.
In particular, the string ‘Kant’ is not in the very long References section,
meaning that it is not in the title of any cited article, or book,
and it is not in the name of any of
the journals where the articles were published.
</p>

<p>
Something similar happens with Hume,
even though he is not a continental philosopher.
Hume is mentioned just twice:
<ul>
<li>
In note 12 to Chapter 3 on a moral question.
The full sentence is:
“The view that to generate an action both desire
and belief must be present is usually attributed to Hume.”
</li>
<li>
In a comparison by Georges Rey cited in Chapter 9,
which says: “consciousness may be no more real than
 the simple soul exorcised by Hume.”
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Neglecting Hume and Kant in an important textbook on the <i>Philosophy of Mind</i>
was so shocking to me that I needed to understand it.
The result was this paper.

Hume's case is notable because:
“The cornerstone of Hume's epistemology is the problem of induction”,
as we read at the start of section
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume#Induction_and_causation"><i>Induction and causation</i></a>
in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume">Wikipedia page on Hume</a>.
</p>


<p>
The paper starts with my interpretation of four
classical texts:
Descartes' <i>Discourse</i> and <i>Meditations</i>,
Hume's <i>Enquiry</i>, and
Kant's <i>Prolegomena</i>.
Descartes was wise in being skeptical,
<i>only what I experience in first person is certain</i>,
and consequent in raising the transcendental problem:
<i>Can I transcend (= go beyond) first person experience?</i>
Hume was right in reasoning that
by causality alone we can go beyond
the here and now of first person experience,
and wise in giving a skeptical solution to the transcendental problem
by arguing that causality cannot be founded on experience,
but that causality is like an instinct that helps us to subsist.
Kant was wise in giving a reversed solution
to the transcendental problem, by concluding that
experience is founded on causality,
and on other devices also implemented in our brain.
</p>

<p>
However, because of their time,
they could suggest but they could not answer
the main question of the cognitive sciences:
<i>Why is our brain as it is and it is not otherwise?</i>
We are now in a better situation:
after Darwin, the answer is evolutionary and,
after Turing, it is computational.
My subjectivist answer is then evolutionary and computational,
but physicalism has difficulties with both qualifications.
Evolution explains life design, but design
has teleological aspects which cannot fit within physicalism.
And computations are not physical events,
but physical events interpreted by a subject,
see <a href="II.html">The Intention of Intention</a>.

<p>
<b>Why is Kant not mentioned in Kim's (2011) <i>Philosophy of Mind</i>?</b>
Because physicalism ignores the transcendental problem
raised by Descartes,
and then its solution by Kant is pointless.
And Kim is a physicalist because
physicalism is the default position in science and in the philosophy of mind.
</p>

<p>
<b>Why is physicalism the default position in science
 and the philosophy mind?</b>
Because of a mix of good intentions with the will of
applying quick and simple solutions to complex problems.
Physicalism tries to repeat the success of physics in
the social siences, so it imposes the ontology of physics on them.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Physicalism is the default position in science
and in the philosophy of mind,
but it should not be, I argue, because of two errors.
By its epistemological error,
physicalism tries to explain theoretically what is evident.
Only what I experience in first person is certain,
so pain does not need a theoretical explanation.
Physics itself is based on first person perception,
avoiding the epistemological error,
and then physics can progress, even changing its own ontology.
However, physicalism imposes the ontology of physics
on every science, and in physics everything is causal.
By its ontological error,
physicalism tries to explain causally what is intentional.
And it happens that
causality and intentionality are mutually exclusive,
showing that the ontology of physics is insufficient
wherever intentions are present.
This ontological insufficiency prevents that
physicalism can repeat the success of physics
with any science where intentions play a rôle,
and thus it is blocking the advance of both
the social sciences and the philosophy of mind.
To overcome this obstacle, I propose to go back to the essentials:
we should consider again the transcendental problem
raised by Descartes and its solutions by Hume and Kant.
On top of this subjectivist solution,
we should take advantage of Darwin and Turing, and
we should extend our ontology beyond causality
to include intentionality,
and here my proposal is problem solving.
Then you could join our Post-Kantian subjectivism and say with me:
The world is not a huge machine,
as physicalism proposes, but an enigmatic problem.
</p>

<h2>Last paragraph</h2>

<p>
Physicalism's intention of
translating the huge success of physics to the social sciences,
 including psychology and the cognitive sciences,
is laudable.
Unfortunately, being a noble intention does not grant success,
and in this case, as I see it, it is the opposite:
because of its epistemological and ontological errors,
physicalism prevents the use of intentionality,
precluding the advance of psychology and the social sciences.
My way out of this obstacle is
to go back to the essentials, that is,
to consider again the transcendental problem raised by Descartes
and its solutions by Hume and Kant.
After that consideration, and on top of it,
we should take advantage of Darwin and Turing.
It is critical, however, to extend our ontology
beyond causality to include intentionality,
and my proposal is problem solving.
Then you could finally join me:
The world is not a huge machine,
as physicalism proposes,
but an enigmatic problem.
<i>The world is an enigmatic problem</i>.
