<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
It presents a problem theory,
which is an intuitionist set theory where the resolving subject is a computing device.
</p>

<p>
A <i>problem</i> is a set defined by intension,
<i>its set of solutions</i> is the same set but defined by extension,
and to <i>resolve</i> a problem is to calculate its set of solutions,
though most times it would be enough to calculate one solution,
that is, it would be enough to <i>solve</i> the problem.
</p>

<p>
Following Turing (1936), computing is the model for the resolutions.
As a resolver implements a resolution, we model a resolver as a Turing machine.
Then we define the <i>range of a resolver</i> as the set of problems that the resolver solves.
If the range of resolver A is a superset of
the range of resolver B, then resolver A is better (at solving) than resolver B.
This allows us to construct a series of improving resolvers.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The Turing machine, as it was presented by Turing himself,
models the calculations done by a person.
This means that we can compute whatever any Turing machine can compute,
and therefore we are Turing complete.
The question addressed here is why,
<i>Why are we Turing complete?</i>
</p>

<p>
Being Turing complete also means that
somehow our brain implements the function that
a universal Turing machine implements.
The point is that evolution achieved
Turing completeness, and then
the explanation should be evolutionary,
but our explanation is mathematical.
The trick is to introduce a
mathematical theory of problems,
under the basic assumption that
solving more problems provides more
survival opportunities.
</p>

<p>
So we build a problem theory by fusing
set and computing theories.
Then we construct a series of resolvers,
where each resolver is defined
by its computing capacity,
that exhibits the following property:
all problems solved by a resolver
are also solved by the next resolver in the series
if certain condition is satisfied.
The last of the conditions is to be Turing complete.
</p>

<p>
This series defines a resolvers hierarchy that
could be seen as a framework for
the evolution of cognition.
Then the answer to our question would be:
<i> to solve most problems</i>.
By the way, the problem theory
 defines adaptation, perception, and learning,
 and it shows that
 there are just three ways to resolve any problem:
 routine, trial, and analogy.
And, most importantly, this theory demonstrates
how problems can be used
to found mathematics and computing on biology.
</p>

</div>

<h2>Series</h2>

<p>
The series of improving resolvers has five elements:
mechanism, adapter, perceiver, learner, and subject.
The best resolver is a Turing complete subject,
which is computationally equivalent to a
universal Turing machine.

It was rejected, date 2015-03-19:
</p>
<i>
<p> While your paper tackles an interesting
 and fundamental AI problem, unfortunately
 it does not satisfy these basic requirements,
 for the following reasons.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Technical correctness. [...]
  Another example of an ambiguous definition is 3.1.6,
  which refers to the undefined concept of
  a purely mechanical process.
 </li>
 <li>
  Lack of scholarship.
  The paper does not include a comparison with
  any other approach to defining (and solving) problems in AI. [...]
 </li>
 <li>
  Clarity of exposition.
  The paper is very heavy on mathematical notation
  and does not include a single example
  or concrete explanation how the new approach
  can be exploited in practice. [...]
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
Please note that this letter should not be taken as
a statement regarding the quality of your research.
The paper has not been reviewed further.
This letter is based on an editorial decision that
the submission does not meet the requirements for JAIR.
