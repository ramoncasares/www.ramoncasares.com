<h2>Definition</h2>

<p>
In this paper, we use Church’s thesis as formulated by Gandy (1980):
<center>
Church’s thesis:
<i>What is effectively calculable is computable</i>.
</center>
</p>


<div id="abstract">
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
We prove that if our calculating capability is
limited to that of a universal Turing machine with a finite tape,
then Church's thesis is true.
This way we accomplish Post (1936) program.
</p>
</div>


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
Post (1936) sketched a device very similar to a Turing machine, and in the very last
paragraph he presented a program that interpreted Church’s thesis as a "<i>natural law</i>"
stating "the limitations of the mathematicizing power of Homo Sapiens". As any natural
law, it was in "need of its continual verification." These are the two last sentences of the
paper by Post.</br>
<i>
The success of the above program would, for us, change this hypothesis not so
much to a definition or to an axiom but to a <em>natural law</em>. Only so, it seems to
the writer, can Gödel’s theorem concerning the incompleteness of symbolic logics
of a certain general type and Church’s results on the recursive unsolvability of
certain problems be transformed into conclusions concerning all symbolic logics
and all methods of solvability.
</i>
</p>

<p>Church's reaction was bipolar.
<ul>
<li>He was the editor who published the paper by Post (1936), even though he was aware
of the yet unpublished paper by Turing (1936), which defined much more completely
the machine and resolved the <i>Entscheidungsproblem</i> as unsolvable.</li>
<li>He wrote an unfavorable review in a later issue of the journal, Church (1937), where
he argued that his thesis was not a natural law, but just a definition.</li>
</ul>

<p>Davis (1982) provides a more detailed explanation of the history of Church’s thesis.
There, you can learn about Gödel’s position on Church’s thesis in 1934, as explained by
Church himself in a letter to Kleene:</br>
<i>
His [Gödel’s] only idea at the time [early in 1934] was that it might be possible,
in terms of effective calculability as an undefined notion, to state a set of axioms
which would embody the generally accepted properties of this notion, and to do
something on that basis.
</i>
</p>

<h2>My position</h2>

<p>
I agree completely with Post (1936).
To me, Church’s thesis is neither a definition, as argued by Church, nor an axiom, as preferred by Gödel,
but a natural law stating the calculating limitations of the members of our own species <i>Homo sapiens</i>.
In fact, in my theory, see
<i><a href="SP.html">Subjectivist Propaganda</a></i>,
<i><a href="II.html">The Intention of Intention</a></i> and
<i><a href="TC.html">On Turing Completeness</a></i>,
Post's law is the fundamental law of cognition.
<center>Law of Post: <i>In calculating capacity, we are just Turing complete</i>.</center>
</p>


<h2>Effective Computation</h2>

<p>Sometimes a natural law is defined in an ideal world, then appearing to us as an
approximation. For example, Newton’s first law of motion requires an ideal frictionless
world. Similarly, in this paper, we find a provision for translating ideal
computing to real computing: "save for time or tape limitations".
<ul>
<li>A <i>finite Turing machine</i> is a Turing machine with a finite tape instead of the infinite
tape.</li>
<li>For each finite Turing machine there is one <i>corresponding Turing machine</i>,
which is the Turing machine that is identical to the finite one, except for the tape.</li>
<li>Proposition: <i>Save for time or tape limitations, every finite Turing machine computes
exactly as its corresponding Turing machine</i>.</li>
</ul>

Comments to the Author:<br>
The author claimed that he proved Church's thesis. The proof is based
on the following new theses:
<ol>
<li>What is effectively calculable is what a person can calculate.</li>
<li>Person's syntax engine is a Finite Universal Turing Machine.</li>
</ol>
where "what a person can calculate" is defined as what her syntax
engine can compute.
</p>

<p>
I do not think the proof is valid, for the following reasons:
<ol>
<li>How much true are your new theses? Note that if your proof is
   based on incorrect assumptions, then you can prove ANY
   thing (recall A -> B is always true if A is false). Also, if your
   assumptions are stronger than Church's thesis, then proving
   Church's thesis is not interesting.</li>

<li>I do not think the conclusion of your section 3 is correct. In fact,
   your finite Turing Machines are finite state automata (bounded
   space is equivalent to no space). Since there are infinitely many
   finite Turing Machines, I do not think there can be a single finite
   Universal Turing Machine that can "simulate" all finite Turing
   Machines.  If you still think your argument is valid, please provide
   a very detailed proof for this (a formal definition of Finite Turing
   Machine, a formal definition of a finite Universal Turing Machine,
   a detailed and formal proof that any finite Turing Machine can be
   simulated by the finite Universal Turing Machine.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
I do not encourage the author to further submit the manuscript
without a very significant revision. I believe that
the author should talk to researchers in the area of computability,
who should be able to tell if a valid proof is presented for
the claimed result.
