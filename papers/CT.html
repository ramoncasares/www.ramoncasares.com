<h2>Thesis</h2>

<p>It is shown that if we are Turing complete, then Church's thesis is true.
And we are Turing complete, save for time or tape limitations and slips.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
We prove that if our calculating capability is
limited to that of a universal Turing machine with a finite tape,
then Church's thesis is true.
This way we accomplish Post (1936) program.

Comments to the Author:<br>
The author claimed that he proved Church's thesis. The proof is based 
on the following new theses:
<ol>
<li>What is effectively calculable is what a person can calculate.</li> 
<li>Person's syntax engine is a Finite Universal Turing Machine.</li>
</ol>
where "what a person can calculate" is defined as what her syntax 
engine can compute. 
</p>

<p>
I do not think the proof is valid, for the following reasons:
<ol>
<li>How much true are your new theses? Note that if your proof is 
   based on incorrect assumptions, then you can prove ANY 
   thing (recall A -> B is always true if A is false). Also, if your 
   assumptions are stronger than Church's thesis, then proving 
   Church's thesis is not interesting.</li>

<li>I do not think the conclusion of your section 3 is correct. In fact, 
   your finite Turing Machines are finite state automata (bounded 
   space is equivalent to no space). Since there are infinitely many 
   finite Turing Machines, I do not think there can be a single finite 
   Universal Turing Machine that can "simulate" all finite Turing 
   Machines.  If you still think your argument is valid, please provide 
   a very detailed proof for this (a formal definition of Finite Turing 
   Machine, a formal definition of a finite Universal Turing Machine, 
   a detailed and formal proof that any finite Turing Machine can be 
   simulated by the finite Universal Turing Machine.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
I do not encourage the author to further submit the manuscript
without a very significant revision. I believe that
the author should talk to researchers in the area of computability,
who should be able to tell if a valid proof is presented for
the claimed result.
