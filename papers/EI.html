<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
Shagrir & Pitowsky (2003) present a device named HM,
and they defend that “HM is a physical system
that computes the function <i>h</i>”, where “<i>h</i>
characterizes the self-halting states of Turing machines.”
</p>

<p>
If that were true, then HM would falsify Church's thesis
and, as I agree completely with Post (1936)
in that Church’s thesis is a natural law
stating the calculating limitations
of the members of our own species <i>Homo sapiens</i>,
then I suspected that they had overlooked something
so I determined to investigate it.
The last paragraph summarizes my conclusion.
</p>


<h2>Last paragraph</h2>

<p>
Contrary to Shagrir & Pitowsky’s “contention that
HM is a physical system that computes the function <i>h</i>” (page 88),
our analysis shows that, either HM is not a physical system,
but an idealization that ignores its errors,
or, if we take into account its errors,
then HM does not compute the function <i>h</i>.
</p>


<h2>Idealizations</h2>

<p>
Shagrir & Pitowsky's idealization abstracts away errors, and
thus they do not discuss how badly errors affect infinite computations.
Andréka et al. (2018) address this issue,
which they resolve by using an unbounded fleet of robots,
that is, by using an idealization, too,
though now one that abstracts away energy and other resources.
In both cases, my argument is that
an idealization cannot falsify a law of nature,
because only observations and measurements can falsify a law of nature,
see <i><a href="SP.html">Subjectivist Propaganda</a></i>,
in this case the law of Post (1936) also known as Church's thesis,
see <i><a href="CT.html">Proof of Church's Thesis</a></i>.
</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
When the error rate is not absolutely zero,
infinite computations are necessarily erroneous,
rendering them uninformative.
This restricts the practical value of
those hypercomputers that perform infinite computations.

<h3>"Errors in Infinite Computations" v1 submitted to M&amp;M</h3>

<p>Submitted to "Minds and Machines" on 20210331.</p>

<p>The article was reviewed and rejected on 20210705 with these comments.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>COMMENTS FOR THE AUTHOR:</p>

    <p>Reviewer #1:
    The author argues that the relativistic machine
    introduced by Shagrir and Pitowsky (2003) does no better than a universal machine.
    The reason being that the error rate in infinite computation
    makes the "oracle" part redundant, in that its signals amount to those of a random source. </p>

    <p>The commentary is brief, concise and clearly written.
    There is some discussion about the error rate
    in relativistic machine in Andréka <em>et al.</em> ("Relativistic computation")
    who reply to Piccinini (2015).
    Their reply is that you can add an error correction mechanism
    that is applied after each computation step.
    It would be essential to clarify the relevance of this reply to the current commentary.   </p>


    <p>Reviewer #2: Despite this submission is under the category "commentary",
    in no way this dispenses the author to make it self-contained and accessible to the reader.
    There is much in terms of definition of basic notions (twin paradox),
    assumptions (T<sub>A</sub> and T<sub>B</sub> table of instructions) and
    unclear conditions ("Except when the temperature of a system is absolute zero,
    we cannot control the system completely") which is left unclarified,
    making the assessment of the argument impossible.
    I also do not understand why the condition of identity
    between thermal equilibrium and constant error rate is necessary.
    The result requires a more solid argumentation and
    the discussion is entirely inadequate to the standards of this journal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reviewer #2 is right.
I was relaying on a "no free lunch" law,
as that negating perpetual motion,
which I took for granted in the paper:
<em>the probability of an erroneous computation step is never zero</em>,
so there are no error-free computation steps,
and error-free computing is an idealization.
One can base that law
on the probabistic nature of quantum mechanics, or
on the laws of thermodinamics.
However, it is better to present it as
an empirical fact of engineering, because in science
empirical facts trump theories.
I should have made this clear, and progress from there.</p>

<p>The error correction mechanism proposed by Andréka <em>et al.</em>
does not use a standard computer T<sub>B</sub>,
nor even a bounded machine, but
"a fleet of self-reproducing robots which carry out
the task of C [T<sub>B</sub>] in a massively parallel self-correcting fashion.
Each robot lives for a finite time, and in each
time instant there are finitely many robots.
However, both numbers are unbounded,
as our fleet of robots follow the strategy
that sometime after each time,
the computation is independently started from the beginning
by more and more new robots with more and more life-expectancy."
That is, in order to decrease the error rate asymptotically to zero,
they have to increase infinitely the redundancy,
in a way that is not physically possible.</p>


<h3>"Errors in Infinite Computations" version 2</h2>

<p>Following the advice given by the two reviewers of M&amp;M,
I have revised the paper and written a second version
on 20210725.</p>

<ul>
    <li>New §3.1 presents the assumptions, in particular the
    <em>no free of errors law</em>, as asked by reviewer #2.</li>
    <li>New §3.4 discusses the proposal by Andréka <em>et al.</em>,
    as required by reviewer #1.</li>
    <li>New §4, Discussion, as demanded by reviewer #2. </li>
</ul>


<h3>"Errors in Infinite Computations" v2 submitted to M&amp;M</h3>

<p>On 20210811, I submitted the second version
of "Errors in Infinite Computations"
to "Minds and Machines".</p>

<p>On 2021-08-13, it was rejected by the editor, without review.</p>


<h3>"Errors in Infinite Computations" v2 submitted to BJPS</h3>

<p>The second version of
"Errors in Infinite Computations"
was submitted to
"The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science"
on 20210817.</p>

<p>It was rejected by BJPS on 20210906:</h2>

<p>“We are sorry not to be able to provide more detailed feedback,
