<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This paper, <i>On Unprecise Numbers</i>, was intended as a second offshoot of
 <i><a href="../GT.html">Gödel Incompleteness and Turing Completeness</a></i>.
My aim was to extend its linguistic viewpoint to numbers.
However, the final version is more a complementary than a derivative work.
</p>

<p>
While writing it, I had to change my mind because I was wrong.
My initial idea was to show that the unprecise numbers were the complete numbers,
where a complete number is any that requires a complete language to be defined.
I was also surprised when I realized that number M is computable.
</p>

<h2>Syntax and semantics</h2>

<p>
The <i>equation of Turing completeness</i> is:
$$\exists\,{\cal U},\forall{\cal P},\forall{\frak d}:\;
  \overleftarrow{{\cal U}\langle\,{\frak p}|\vec{\frak d}\,\rangle}
  = {\cal P}\langle{\frak d}\rangle \;.$$
</p>

<p>
In the equation, $\langle\,{\frak p}|\vec{\frak d}\,\rangle$
is the computation that applies coded data $\vec{\frak d}$ to program $\frak p$,
where $\frak p$ is the Turing machine $\cal P$ coded in
the complete language $\cal L$ implemented by the universal Turing machine $\cal U$.
For the equation of Turing completeness to work,
the string $\langle\,{\frak p}|\vec{\frak d}\,\rangle$
has to be a well-formed formula of language $\cal L$.
In other words, the syntax of $\cal L$ has to be decidable,
because otherwise the equation of Turing completeness does not work.
</p>

<p>
Since the well-formed formulas, or sentences, of the complete language $\cal L$ are computations,
then the semantics of $\cal L$ expresses computations.
And since the <i>halting theorem</i> says that
<center><i>no program can decide for every computation whether it will halt or not</i>,</center><br>
then the semantics of the complete language $\cal L$ is undecidable.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the <i>Corollary</i> to the halting theorem says that
<center><i>in every complete language, syntax is decidable but semantics is undecidable</i>.</center>
</p>


<h2>Paradoxes</h2>

<p>
As a consequence of the Corollary to the halting theorem,
there are paradoxes in every complete language.
A <i>paradox</i> is a non-halting computation, that is,
a well-formed formula, or sentence, of a complete language $\cal L$
the semantics of which we cannot reach because it closes an infinite loop.
</p>

<p>
The halting theorem can now be stated as follows:
<center><i>we cannot decide for every sentence whether it is a paradox or not</i>.</center>
</p>


<hr />

<h2>Last paragraph</h2>

<p>
Let me conclude answering our first question:
Why do not we use, in practice, any uncomputable number?
Because, being under the law of Post,
we cannot conceptualize what is not computable.
In figurative language,
 what is uncomputable is in our conceptual blind spot.
While paradoxes show that our conceptual blind spot is not precise,
so the unprecise numbers are in its twilight,
the blind spot itself provides another argument
for the law of Post.
</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Regarding computability,
there are three kinds of real numbers:
 the computable, the random, and the unprecise numbers.
Some unprecise numbers are
those based on Radó's busy beaver functions,
Chaitin's constant Ω, and
those coding the halting problem oracle of a Turing complete language.
Since <i>number</i> is an undecidable concept,
the unprecise numbers are its paradoxical instances.
We show that there are paradoxes in every Turing complete language
because its syntax is decidable but its semantics is undecidable.</p>

<h3>"On Unprecise Numbers" v1 submitted to the arXiv</h3>

<p>Submitted on 20250606.
The new version (1.5) of the submission software blocked my
submission because a conflict of lang,
that is, because some files were labeled as plain
 and others (wrongly) as LaTeX.
I ask for help, and they allowed me to submitt the PDF file.
</p>

<p>
It was rejected on 20250612, using their standard words:
