<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This paper, <i>On Unprecise Numbers</i>, was intended as a second offshoot of
 <i><a href="../GT.html">Gödel Incompleteness and Turing Completeness</a></i>.
My aim was to extend its linguistic viewpoint to numbers.
In particular, I wanted to argue that, although
there are infinitely many more uncomputable than computable numbers,
we only use computable numbers
because of our linguistic limitations.
</p>

<p>
While writing it, I had to change my mind because I was wrong.
Following an intuition by Turing,
my initial idea was to show that the unprecise numbers were the complete numbers,
where a complete number is any that requires a complete language to be defined.
I was surprised when I realized that
complete number <i>R</i> is not unprecise, but computable.
</p>

<p>
The unprecise numbers are irrational,
and the irrational numbers require semantics.
However, there are irrational numbers that are computable,
so requiring semantics is not definitive.
Finally, what characterizes the unprecise numbers
is semidecidability.
</p>


<h2>Syntax and semantics</h2>

<p>
The <i>equation of Turing completeness</i> is:
$$\exists\,{\cal U},\forall{\cal P},\forall{\frak d}:\;
  \overleftarrow{{\cal U}\langle\,{\frak p}|\vec{\frak d}\,\rangle}
  = {\cal P}\langle{\frak d}\rangle \;.$$
</p>

<p>
In the equation, $\langle\,{\frak p}|\vec{\frak d}\,\rangle$
is the computation that applies coded data $\vec{\frak d}$ to program $\frak p$,
where $\frak p$ is the Turing machine $\cal P$ coded in
the complete language $\cal L$ implemented by the universal Turing machine $\cal U$.
</p>

<p>
The <i>syntax</i> of the complete language $\cal L$ is
the set of its sentences, or well-formed formulas,
denoted $\Sigma_{\cal L}$.
For the equation of Turing completeness to work,
the string $\langle\,{\frak p}|\vec{\frak d}\,\rangle$
has to be a well-formed formula of language $\cal L$,
and then the requirement is to decide,
for every string of symbols of the universal Turing machine $\cal U$,
whether it is a well-formed formula or not,
that is,
$\forall s \in \Gamma^*_{\cal U}$, to decide
whether $s\in\Sigma_{\cal L}$ or $s\notin\Sigma_{\cal L}$.
In other words,
syntax $\Sigma_{\cal L}$ is decidable.
</p>

<p>
Since the well-formed formulas, or sentences, of the complete language $\cal L$ are computations,
then the semantics of $\cal L$ expresses computations;
the meaning of sentence
 $\langle\,{\frak p}|\vec{\frak d}\,\rangle$
 is ${\cal P}\langle{\frak d}\rangle$.
But, since we are finite, we can only reach the meaning of the halting computations,
then for us <i>semantics</i>, denoted $\Psi_{\!\cal L}$, is the set of the halting computations;
so $\Psi_{\cal L} \subset \Sigma_{\cal L}$.
The <i>halting theorem</i> says that
<center><i>no program can decide for every computation whether it will halt or not</i>.</center><br>
In other words,
semantics $\Psi_{\!\cal L}$ is undecidable.
</p>

<p>
Summarizing,<br>
<center><i>in every complete language $\cal L$,
 syntax $\mit\Sigma_{\cal L}$ is decidable but semantics $\mit\Psi_{\!\cal L}$ is undecidable</i>.</center><br>
Thus, in the Euler diagram of the complete language $\cal L$,
the limits of syntax $\Sigma_{\cal L}$ are precise,
but the limits of semantics $\Psi_{\!\cal L}$ are unprecise.

<h2>Numbers, strings and sets</h2>

<p>
There are bijections
between the strings and the natural numbers,
between the natural and the integer numbers, and
between the natural and the rational numbers,
$\Sigma_{\cal L} \leftrightarrow {\mathbb N}
 \leftrightarrow {\mathbb Z} \leftrightarrow {\mathbb Q}$.
Then any rational number can be coded
into a string of the complete language.
</p>

<p>
In the case of the real numbers,
the bijection is between the real numbers and
the sets of natural numbers,
${\mathbb R} \leftrightarrow 2^{\mathbb N}$.
Then, each real number has to be coded into
a set of strings of the complete language.
And computing classifies the sets of strings as follows.
<ul>
<li>Decidable: if <i>both</i> itself and its complement
 are computably enumerable.</li>
<li>Semidecidable: if only one, <i>either</i> itself or its complement,
 is computably enumerable.</li>
<li>Undefinable: if <i>neither</i> itself nor its complement
 is computably enumerable.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Therefore, we can classify the real numbers accordingly.
<ul>
<li>Computable: if its corresponding set is <i>decidable</i>.</li>
<li>Unprecise: if its corresponding set is <i>semidecidable</i>.</li>
<li>Random: if its corresponding set is <i>undefinable</i>.</li>
</ul>
$$\hbox{Real}\left\{
  \eqalign{&\hbox{Computable = Decidable}\cr
    &\hbox{Uncomputable}
     \left\{\eqalign{&\hbox{Unprecise = Semidecidable}\cr
         &\hbox{Random = Undefinable}\cr}\right.}\right.
$$</p>

<p>
The rational numbers are syntactic,
since each one can be coded into a single string;
for example, the rational number three quarters
 gets coded into the string "3/4",
 and minus one seventh into "-1/7".
On the other hand, each irrational number,
with its non-repeating infinite expansion,
has to be coded by an infinite set of strings;
for example the set of the strings coding those integer numbers <i>n</i>
for which the <i>n</i>-th bit of its positional binary expression is 1.
And, in order to define an infinite set,
a program that enumerates it is required.
Being defined on the behavior of programs,
the irrational numbers are semantic.
</p>

<h2>Last two paragraphs</h2>

<p>
Let me conclude answering our first question:
Why do not we use, in practice, any uncomputable number?
We know now that we can define and use the unprecise numbers,
which are classified as uncomputable though they are, more precisely, semicomputable.
In any case, since the unprecise numbers
 are few (relative to the random ones) and
 seldom used (relative to the computable ones),
considering them either computable or uncomputable does not affect my answer,
which follows, save for adding some detail.
</p>

<p>Should we were able to calculate beyond what is computable,
 then we would use, whenever we should see fit, super-computable numbers,
 which would be those numbers that are beyond what is computable,
 that is, the uncomputable numbers. Therefore, either
<ul>
<li>we cannot calculate what is not computable, or</li>
<li>the uncomputable numbers are useless.</li>
</ul>
I think the first case, which derives from the law of Post, is true,
 see <a href="CT.html">Casares (C)</a>,
which would explain why Church’s thesis was not yet refuted.
If I am right about this, then the second case is inconsequential,
even though it is likely false, since
there are infinitely many more uncomputable than computable numbers.
And, consequently, my answer is that
we do not use uncomputable numbers because, being under the law of Post,
<i>we cannot calculate what is not computable</i>.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Regarding computability,
there are three kinds of real numbers:
 the computable, the random, and the unprecise numbers.
Some unprecise numbers are
those based on Radó's busy beaver functions,
Chaitin's constant Ω,
Turing's uncomputable number δ, and
those coding the halting problem oracle of a Turing complete language.
All these unprecise numbers are complete,
because they can only be defined in a Turing complete language,
but we prove, against one of Turing's intuitions, that
not every complete number is unprecise.
We also show that, while
a rational number can be coded into a string,
a real number has to be coded into a set of strings,
and thus an unprecise number is
any coded into a semidecidable set.

I ask for help, and they allowed me to submitt the PDF file.
