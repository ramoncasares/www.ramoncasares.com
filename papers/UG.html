<h2>Opening question</h2>

<p>
The word ‘universal’ is used differently
in computing, as in ‘universal Turing machine’, and
in linguistics, as in ‘Universal Grammar’. But:
<em>Could it be that both ‘universals’ are nevertheless the same?</em>
</p>


<h2>Comment</h2>

<p>
This paper is a continuation of <a href="SE.html">Sintax Evolution</a>,
and it is founded on the same two bases:

<ul>
<li>from Chomsky (1959), that the best point of view to explain syntax and language
is computing, and</li>
<li>from Turing (1936), that from the point
of view of computing, we humans are Turing complete.</li>
</ul>

Computing is a point of view that
 defines decidability and Turing completeness, and
 that distinguishes program from data and hardware from software.
These concepts are needed to explain the cognitive gap between our species,
 <i>Homo sapiens</i>, and all others:
we are the first and only species that achieved Turing completeness.
Being Turing complete means that we can do by software whatever hardware does,
so we can imagine anything that evolution could build,
thus speeding up problem solving enormously.
Turing completeness needs a complete language in which programs are treated as data, and
any complete language has to fulfill two requirements:

<ul>
<li>its syntax has to be an infinite
set, which can be decidable, and</li>
<li>it has to implement a functional semantics,
 where functional semantics is the semantics of syntax,
 and then its place is the core syntax.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This way we reach our thesis:  Universal Grammar is Turing complete.
Or, in other words,
the human brain circuitry that implements language is Turing complete.
</p>

<p>
Our thesis that Universal Grammar is Turing complete implies that
there are not unlearnable languages.
This, together with the fact that
natural languages are neither one nor any,
demands a distinction between
<ul>
<li>native language, which is developed,</li>
<li>first language, which is acquired, and</li>
<li>later languages, which are learned,</li>
</ul>
where all natural languages are first languages,
and our native language is not accessible.
Two consequences follow:
<ul>
<li>Not every language can be acquired, but we can learn any language.</li>
<li>Instruction is a way of learning, once we have acquired a first complete language.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Computing is a problem solving point of view from which language is a tool to
translate problems to the hardware that resolves them.
Two consequences follow:
<ul>
<li>Language influences thinking, but a complete language does not limit thinking.</li>
<li>Turing completeness is a fixed point in the evolution of Universal Grammar.</li>
</ul>
Universal Grammar evolved as a compromise that
took into account its various functions and its implementation.
Universal Grammar functions include, at least,
language, mathematics, and problem solving, and
its implementation had to resolve its interaction with
other brain modules while still satisfying other engineering conditions.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Language is the most distinctive feature of humans, but
there is no consensus on what is characteristic of language.
From the point of view of computing, we argue that
'the human brain circuitry that implements language
 is Turing complete'.
This thesis makes evolutionary sense, and
natural languages are expressive enough,
but two issues against it remain:
natural language syntax is decidable, and
not every possible language can be a natural language.
We answer the first showing that
the syntax of a complete language can be decidable, and
blaming functional semantics for the undecidability,
where functional semantics is the semantics of syntax.
To answer the second we distinguish
native language, first language, and later languages,
where all natural languages are first languages
acquired during a critical period that
eases the process by preventing some possibilities.
The thesis supports the weak version of the
linguistic relativity hypothesis,
and explains the role played by language
in the cognitive gap that
separates our species from the rest.

<h2>Last paragraph</h2>

<p>
This is the theory I am proposing here for your consideration.
The theory is firmly founded on two bases:
firstly, that the best point of view to explain syntax and language
is computing, which is the essence of Chomsky (1959), and
secondly, that from the point of view of computing,
we humans are Turing complete, which is the essence of Turing (1936).
Then there are some assumptions that you will have to assess,
but they are very few, and the only important thesis is that
Universal Grammar is Turing complete.

<i><p>
An initial review of "Universal Grammar is a universal grammar"
has allowed us to conclude that this submission
does not fit within the scope and focus of the journal.
Your article consists of a series of statements,
some of them well known, others less so,
but all of them are posited with little argument.
Let me give an example.
You write "We are now ready to state its definition:
Universal Grammar is the human brain circuitry
that implements the faculty of language."
You present this as if it were a discovery you have made,
while is seems to be the common view.
Also, your section 6 on evolution is simply unintelligible.
