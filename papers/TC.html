<h2>Thesis</h2>

<p>My main thesis is that Turing completeness is what characterizes our human cognition,
and this is the paper where this is directly addressed, so it is a good place to start reading.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Why are we so many?
Or, in other words,
Why is our species so successful?
The ultimate cause of our success as species
is that we, <i>Homo sapiens</i>, are
the first and the only Turing complete species.
Turing completeness is the capacity of some hardware
to compute by software whatever hardware can compute.
</p>

<p>
To reach the answer,
I propose to see evolution and computing
from the problem solving point of view.
Then,
solving more problems is evolutionarily better,
computing is for solving problems, and
software is much cheaper than hardware,
resulting that
Turing completeness is evolutionarily disruptive.
This conclusion, together with the fact that
 we are the only Turing complete species,
is the reason that explains why we are so many.
</p>

<p>
Most of our unique cognitive characteristics
as humans can be derived from being Turing complete,
as for example our complete language and
our problem solving creativity.
