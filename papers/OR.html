<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
In rejecting
<a href="MR.html">Merge Is Not Recursion</a>,
they wrote:
"Moreover, one could say that the 'recursion dispute' has been settled for
good with Watumull et al.'s (2014) Frontiers in Psychology article".
So I took "On Recursion" by Watumull et al. (2014)
as the position of linguistics on recursion,
and I compared it against recursion in mathematics.
</p>

<p>
In mathematics,
Turing (1937) proved that
every recursive function is computable
 and
every computable function is recursive.
In linguistics,
recursion by Watumull et al. (2014) is more stringent,
because for them
every recursive function is computable,
 but
not every computable function is recursive.
</p>

<p>
Given the difference, my question is:
Should linguistics deviate from mathematics on recursion?
And my answer is no.
No, it should not, because Watumull et al. (2014)
are modifying the mathematical definition of recursive function
to discriminate human language from other animal communication systems,
and mathematical recursion already does that discrimination.
</p>

<p>
This paper was a forerunner for
<a href="CH.html">A Complete Hierarchy of Languages</a>.

   is not suitable for your journal.
   There simply is no argument relevant to linguistics
