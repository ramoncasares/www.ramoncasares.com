<h2>Thesis</h2>

<p>
In mathematics,
Turing (1937) proved that
every recursive function is computable
 and
every computable function is recursive.
In linguistics,
recursion by Watumull et al. (2014) is more stringent,
because for them
every recursive function is computable,
 but
not every computable function is recursive.
So my question is:
Should linguistics deviate from mathematics on recursion?
</p>

<p>
No, it should not, because Watumull et al. (2014)
are modifying the mathematical definition of recursive function
to discriminate human language from other animal communication systems,
and mathematical recursion already does that discrimination.

This paper was a forerunner for 
<a href="CH.html">A Complete Hierarchy of Languages</a>.
