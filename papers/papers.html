<p>These are my <strong>papers</strong> on the evolution of cognition, by subject:</p>

<h2>Cognition</h2>

<p>Those with a wider scope are here. They are philosophical and concerned with the foundations of cognitive science.</p>


<h3><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5631922">On Turing Completeness, or Why We Are So Many</a></h3>

<p>My main thesis is that Turing completeness is what characterizes our human cognition,
and this is the paper where this is directly addressed, so it is a good place to start reading.</p>

<p>Link to the page of my paper on Turing completeness in
 <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/On_Turing_Completeness_or_Why_We_Are_So_Many/5631922">figshare</a>,
 and direct link to the
 <a href="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/10088718">pdf file</a>.
 An older version is in
 <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3093516">SSRN</a>.

<h3><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7928240">The Intention of Intention</a></h3>

<p>Taking "Representation and Reality" by Putnam as the best critique on the foundations of cognitive science,
I propose evolutionary subjectivism modeled as problem solving by computing as the basis for cognitive science.</p>

</p>


<h3><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5450278">Putnam's Rocks Are Clocks</a></h3>

<p>Contains my analysis of Putnam's realization theorem in "Representation and Reality".
It was a forerunner for the previous one.</p>

<h2>Mathematics</h2>

<p>The mathematical papers on the evolution of cognition are here.</p>


<h3><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4955501">Proof of Church's Thesis</a></h3>

<p>It is shown that if we are Turing complete, then Church's thesis is true.
And we are Turing complete, save for time or tape limitations and slips.</p>

<p>Link to the page of my "proof" of the Church-Turing thesis in the
 <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5036">arXiv</a>,
 and direct link to the
 <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.5036v5">pdf file</a>.
 A second version is in
 <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Proof_of_Church_s_Thesis/4955501">figshare</a>,
 with its
 <a href="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/8332307">pdf file</a>.
</p>


<h3><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4956353">Problem Theory</a></h3>

<p>It presents a problem theory,
 which is an intuitionist set theory where the resolving subject is a computing device.</p>

<p>Link to the page of my problem theory in the
 <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1044">arXiv</a>,
 and direct link to the
 <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.1044v6">pdf file</a>.
 A second version is in

 with its
 <a href="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/8333651">pdf file</a>.
 And there is another version in
 <a href="https://archive.org/details/ProblemTheory">The Internet Archive</a>.

<h2>Linguistics</h2>

<p>Though not myself a linguist, the evolution of cognition has something to say on linguistics.</p>


<h3><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4956359">Syntax Evolution: Problems and Recursion</a></h3>

<p>We are syntactically too competent for syntax,
because we are Turing complete and syntax does not require as much.
This is an evolutionary anomaly, which we call the anomaly of syntax, that
suggests us that syntax and problem solvig co-evolved in humans towars Turing completeness.</p>

<p>Link to the page of my paper on
 the co-evolution of syntax and problem solving
 in the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03040">arXiv</a>,
 and direct link to the
 <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.03040v6">pdf file</a>.
 A second version is in
 <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Syntax_Evolution_Problems_and_Recursion/4956359">figshare</a>,
 with its
 <a href="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/8334335">pdf file</a>.
 Another version is in
 <a href="https://archive.org/details/Resolution_Machinery">The Internet Archive</a>,
 with its
 <a href="https://archive.org/download/Resolution_Machinery/Syntax.pdf">pdf file</a>.
 There is an older and obsolete version titled "Resolution Machinery"
 in <a href="http://cogprints.org/9209/">Cogprints</a>, with its
 <a href="http://cogprints.org/9209/1/Syntax-20140225.pdf">pdf file</a>.
</p>


<h3><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4956764">Universal Grammar is a universal grammar</a></h3>

<p>It shows that "the human brain circuitry that implements language is Turing complete",
it resolves some objections about it, and
it extracts some implications on the architecture of human languages.</p>

<p>Link to my paper on the thesis that
 "the human brain circuitry that implements language is Turing complete", in

<h3><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4958822">Merge Is Not Recursion</a></h3>

<p>My review of "Why Only Us" by Berwick and Chomsky.
I have found two issues:
their definition of recursion is not the mathematical one, and
the strong minimalist thesis is too strong, and then
it is not enough to explain the evolution of Merge to explain the evolution of language,
which is what they are proposing in the book.</p>

<h3><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5097691">On "On Recursion"</a></h3>

<p>My review of "On Recursion" by Watumull et al.
They modify the mathematical definition of "recursive function" to discriminate human language from other animal communication systems,
but I argue instead that linguistic recursion should not deviate from mathematical recursion.
It was a forerunner for "A Complete Hierarchy of Languages".</p>

 <a href="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/8788543">pdf file</a>.
</p>


<h3><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6126917">A Complete Hierarchy of Languages</a></h3>

<p>The thesis is that human language is best characterized as a Turing complete language.
A hiearachy of languages is presented where languages are ordered by their expressiveness.</p>
