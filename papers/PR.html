<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
Contains my analysis of the realization theorem by Putnam (1988),
which is in the Appendix to "Representation and Reality".
The theorem proves that
<i>everything has every functional organization</i>.
At first sight, I thought that this could not be true,
and then it seemed to me that
something in the proof should be wrong.
As I did not like Chalmer's (1996) solution,
I investigated it by myself.

It was a forerunner for

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Putnam proved that
"every ordinary open system is a realization of
  every abstract finite automaton",
showing that computing is meaningless.
Analyzing a simpler version of his proof, we conclude that
giving a meaning to a computation requires computing,
which is meaningless, starting a recursion.

<i>Many thanks for submitting your manuscript
for publication in Synthese.
It addresses an important issue.
Synthese, however, is not its proper home,
since it does not publish short papers.
You may want to submit the work to a journal that does.</i>
