\section What is METATeX?

METATeX is a set of plain TeX and METAFONT macros that you can use to
define both the text and the figures in a single source file. Because
METATeX sets up two way communication, from TeX to METAFONT and back
from METAFONT to TeX, drawing dimensions can be controlled by TeX and
labels can be located by METAFONT. Only standard features of TeX and
METAFONT are used, but two runs of TeX and one of METAFONT are needed.


\section How to use METATeX?

Please read the TUGboat paper on METATeX to get an explanation. The
paper is provided here in pdf format (mtpaper.pdf). To recreate yourself
the paper, you will need the plain TUGboat style files (tugboat.cmn and
tugboat.sty), in addition to the sources located in the mtpaper subdir
(mtpaper.tex, delay.mf, diagram.tex, frame.tex and shadow.tex).

The original TUGboat paper on METATeX is:

"METATeX" by Ram\'on Casares.
   TUGboat (ISSN 0896-3207)
   Volume 23, Number 3/4, pp. 313-318, 2002.
